# Game-Whack-a-Mole
This is my first C# project with Windows Forms. The idea was simple - to implement the famous "catch the mole" game using the Form tools.
Whack a Mole game developed in C# and Windows Forms with minimal required graphical user interface. The project was created and developed for educational purposes - for a better understanding and assimilation of the principles of work and syntax in C # + WF
